# Prepod – Broadcast PDF Slides
**Locally. No Internet needed.**

Instantly show your presentation on any screen. Attendees do not have to install any apps.

Broadcast a presentation to any device from your iPad or iPhone simultaneously and wirelessly in two simple steps.

Step One. Select and open a PDF on your device.

Step Two. Show others the QR-code that they can scan and join them to your presentation from any web browser. Alternatively, they can manually enter the IP-address into a web browser address bar.

Boom! The current slide is on their screens now. When you change pages, all other connected devices instantly do the same.

Imagine everyone in the room is watching your presentation in front of them, holding the slide in their hands – there is no need for glasses anymore or shutting out the lights.
